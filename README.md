# metis_project_3

For project 3 I am classifying imported Q-graded coffee beans by their country of origin. 

I'm utilizing the dataset created by https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database

Coffee from various regions have distinct flavor and aroma characteristics much as wine varieties do - the terroir contributes significantly to the characteristics of the brew so this should result in some reasonably consistent and identifiable trends.

I have some concerns about the smallish size of the dataset at ~1300 rows, but should be able to scrape new additions from mid-2018 and onwards in order to beef up my set a bit once my MVP is achieved. 

I intend to develop a flask app and add visualizations using d3.
