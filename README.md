# metis_project_3

For project 3 I am classifying imported Q-graded coffee beans by their country of origin. 

I'm utilizing the dataset created by https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database

Coffee from various regions have distinct flavor and aroma characteristics much as wine varieties do - the terroir contributes significantly to the characteristics of the brew so this should result in some reasonably consistent and identifiable trends.
